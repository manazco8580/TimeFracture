Game Story:
A man named William Jackson has the powers to shift through time. He got his power during an accident with an experiment that was held by William’s friends who wanted to help change the past for the better future, but as they demonstrate the idea of time travel to William, there is a malfunction in the system that caused a fracture in time. The reason why William wanted to change the future is because a company named “Micron” took control of the world in the present time. When “Micron” found out that William went in the time machine, they try to find him through time to stop him from changing their fate. William’s mission is to hunt down the headquarters of “Micron” and eliminate the enemies to get the man who started and controls the company. Once “Micron” is defeated, the future and present will be free from “Micron”.

Game Play:
The game TimeFracture is based on a sci-fi, action, side scroller, and shooter game. There will be multiple levels in the game and the last level will be the boss fight. These levels will have many have enemies and obstacles like floor spikes and soldiers firing bullets at you. If you take too much damage then you will die and the game will be over. You will be able to fire your gun to kill your enemies and beside just shooting your gun, you have special time powers that will assist you in combat. These powers are Time Shield which will protect you from any damage for a short amount of time, Time Blast which fires a powerful projectile that does massive damage and goes through multiple amount of enemies, and Time Slow which slows down everything around you except yourself for a short amount of time. Using these time powers will also come with a price, that price is the amount of time power energy that you have. Every time power ablities that you use consumes a certain amount of time power energy you have but can be replenished by collecting fragments of time power energy that appears on certain levels. Health can also be replenished by collecting healthpacks that appear on certain levels too.
